## BIO

> I'm a positive, dynamic, and determined person, always ready to take on new challenges and put myself to the test. I completed both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree at the Academy of Fine Arts in Palermo, a journey that enriched me both artistically and personally. Alongside my studies, I completed a year of civil service and worked as a pizza assistant during my last two years of university, where I learned how to manage my time effectively and balance academic and work commitments. Volunteering has always been part of my life, helping me to develop a strong sense of responsibility and teamwork.

> I've always had a passion for IT and technology, which led me to attend a Junior Java Developer course with Generation Italy. There, I learned the basics of programming in Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as relational database management with MySQL. In addition to technical skills, I also developed essential soft skills such as effective communication and teamwork by participating in group projects that required idea-sharing and collaborative problem-solving. This experience gave me a solid foundation in the tech sector and strengthened my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills.

> My positive energy helps me create a stimulating and inclusive work environment, while my determination drives me to achieve goals with dedication and commitment.

#### Education : Bachelor’s and Master’s degree at the Academy of Fine Arts of Palermo.
